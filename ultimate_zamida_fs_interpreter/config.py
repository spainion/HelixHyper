"""Configuration loader for environment variables.

This module provides a simple `load_env` function that reads a local
`.env` file and a YAML configuration file from a `config` directory.  It
populates `os.environ` with any key/value pairs found in those files
without overwriting existing environment variables.  The `.env` file
should contain lines of the form `KEY=value`.  The YAML file
(`api_keys.yaml` by default) should map keys to values.  If either
file is missing, the loader silently continues.

    The function looks in the current working directory for a `.env`

    `.env` file containing an equals sign, the key and value are
    separated and any surrounding whitespace trimmed.  Environment
    variables that are already set are left unchanged.

    If the YAML configuration file exists and the `yaml` package is
    available, it is parsed and any topâ€‘level mappings are merged into
    `os.environ` as strings.  Missing files are ignored.
