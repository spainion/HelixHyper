# Build and Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to work with the full HelixHyper system:

1. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Adjust configuration in `config/` as needed, particularly `logging.yaml` for log levels and file locations.
3. Run `pytest -q` to ensure the codebase imports and tests pass.
4. Use the CLI or API components once implemented to interact with the graph.

Keep documentation up to date as new modules are added.
